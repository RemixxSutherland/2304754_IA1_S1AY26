	<h2>Report on an AI Business Idea</h2>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> AI-Powered Personal Learning Companions.</p>

	<h4>Application in My World</h4>
<p>This idea could be applied as a "Coding Tutor Bot" specifically for UTech students. It would be a web app that understands the Web Programming syllabus. A student could ask it to explain CSS Flexbox in simple terms, generate practice problems, or review their code for errors. It would be useful because it provides 24/7 personalized help, which is great when lecturers are busy or labs are closed.</p>

	<h4>Ethical Issues & Solution</h4>
<p><strong>Issue:</strong> The biggest ethical concern is academic dishonesty. Students might use it to generate entire assignments instead of learning. <strong>Solution:</strong> The app could be designed as a "Socratic tutor" that never gives direct answers but asks guiding questions. It could also have a feature that explains its reasoning, turning it into a teaching tool, not a cheating tool.</p>

	<h4>Real App Example</h4>
<p>An app in this area is <strong>Khan Academy's Khanmigo</strong>. It's an AI-powered tutor that guides students through problems without giving away the answer.</p>
