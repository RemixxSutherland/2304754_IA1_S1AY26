	<h2>My Personality</h2>
<h3>Top 3 Traits & Hobbies</h3>
<ul class="hobby-list">

<li><strong>Relaxed:</strong> This helps me stay calm during stressful school deadlines and group projects, allowing me to think clearly.</li>

<li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Improves my problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination, which is surprisingly useful for debugging code and long hours at the computer.</li>

<li><strong>Animating / 3D Modeling:</strong> This fuels my creativity and attention to detail, directly impacting how I design visually appealing and structured web layouts.</li>

</ul>

	<h3>My Heroes</h3>

<p><strong>Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece):</strong> I admire Luffy not because he's a hero, but because of his unwavering commitment to his dream and his carefree nature. From a young age, he knew exactly what he wanted and pursues it with absolute freedom. He reminds me to stay true to my goals and not be pulled down by life's stresses.</p>

<p><strong>Yoshikage Kira (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure):</strong> While his methods are villainous, his core desire for a "quiet life" resonates with me. He values peace, routine, and simplicity. It's a reminder that amidst the chaos of ambition, finding personal peace is a valid and important goal.</p

	<h2>Personal Development</h2>

	<h3>Summary of "Twelve Pillars" (Chapters 4-7)</h3>

<p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> This chapter emphasizes the power of association and surrounding yourself with positive, motivated people. I can align this by seeking out study groups and peers in my web programming course who are serious about coding.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5:</strong> It's about the importance of writing down goals. To align with this, I will start documenting my weekly learning targets for HTML, CSS, and future JavaScript, making my progress measurable.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6:</strong> Focuses on the continuous improvement of skills. In my life, this means not stopping at the basics. I will challenge myself to rebuild my favorite website layouts as practice.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> This chapter is about the time to act is now. I can apply this by immediately starting my personal projects instead of waiting to feel "perfectly ready," learning by doing.</p>
